🖼️ Image Caption Generator

An AI-powered web application that generates natural language captions for images using Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
Built with TensorFlow/Keras, trained on a custom dataset in Google Colab, and deployed with a clean Streamlit UI.

🚀 Features

📷 Upload any image (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)

🤖 AI generates captions describing the image

🎨 Modern, responsive Streamlit UI

🧠 Trained with CNN + RNN architecture for caption generation

📂 Includes pretrained model (model.keras), tokenizer (tokenizer.pkl), and feature extractor

⚙️ Installation

1. Download dataset (images and captions): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Sanchettol/Image-Caption-Generator-using-Deep-Learning.git
   cd NLP

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

3. Install dependencies
   pip install streamlit
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage (run the project)
Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run main.py

Upload an image from your computer.

Wait for the model to process.

Get a caption describing your image.

📒 Training Notebook

Check out the Colab notebook Image_Caption_Generator.ipynb
for:

Dataset preprocessing

Model training (CNN + LSTM)

Evaluation on test images

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is included in the dataset/ folder (or you can download MS COCO/Flickr8k).
or you can install the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k

Captions are mapped to corresponding images.

You can retrain the model with your own dataset by running the notebook.

📌 Requirements

Python 3.8+

TensorFlow / Keras

Streamlit

NumPy, Pandas, Pickle

Pillow

(Install with pip install -r requirements.txt)
